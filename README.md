<h1 align="center"><a>Turning Smartphones into Robots</a></h1>

OpenBot = low-cost robots + Android for brains. Does person following and real-time autonomous navigation.

This is my implementation of OpenBot. Here's why I'm making it:

- Integrate a graphics library I had written for computer vision + OpenGL on Android.
- Speed up the same thing to work with a car that goes at 30km/h.
- Use clean Android architecture and satisfy my inner craving to write code. (So far it's all POC (read, pukable code), so don't read please thanks).

I've modified the code heavily. Please have a look at the original forked source if you'd like to.

## Getting started with OpenBot

- Build your own [Robot Body](body/README.md)
- Flash the [Arduino Firmware](firmware/README.md)
- Compile and run the [Android App](android/README.md)
- Train your own [Driving Policy](policy/README.md)
